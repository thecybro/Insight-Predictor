# InsightPredictor – Ranked Feature List

## Core Features (MVP / must-have)
1. **Dataset Input Parsing** – Accept CSV, JSON, or structured user input.  
2. **Basic Statistical Analysis** – Compute mean, variance, standard deviation.  
3. **Correlation & Covariance** – Identify relationships between features.  
4. **Linear Regression Predictions** – Predict Y from X or X from Y.  
5. **Output Reasoning** – Explain why a prediction was made (“Column A strongly influences outcome”).  
6. **Anomaly Detection (Basic)** – Flag obvious outliers in datasets.  

## Intermediate Features (Phase 2 / high-priority expansion)
7. **Multiple Prediction Types** – Support regression and classification.  
8. **Confidence Scoring** – Assign a confidence metric to each prediction.  
9. **Feature Contribution Analysis** – Show which variables influence outcomes most.  
10. **Advanced Anomaly Detection** – Detect subtle or multi-feature anomalies.  

## Advanced / ML Features (Phase 3 / optional but valuable)
11. **ML Algorithm Integration** – Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression.  
12. **Model Comparison** – Evaluate multiple models and select the best one.  
13. **Explainable ML Predictions** – Show reasoning behind ML predictions (feature weights, importance).  
14. **Time-Series Prediction** – Forecast trends over time (optional advanced use case).  
15. **Visualization & Reporting** – Graphs, heatmaps, dashboards for predictions and insights.  
16. **Web Interface (Optional)** – Flask/FastAPI frontend for data input and output display.  

## Future/Stretch Features (nice-to-have)
17. **Automated Preprocessing & Feature Engineering** – Clean and optimize datasets automatically.  
18. **Ensemble Models & Cross-Validation** – Improve prediction accuracy and reliability.  
19. **Interactive Notebook Integration** – Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis.  
20. **Custom User Modules** – Let users define their own statistical or ML functions.
