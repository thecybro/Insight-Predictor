Here is a **clear, ranked priority roadmap with hour estimates**, designed to **force learning**, avoid fluff, and mirror why you enjoyed the Budget Tracker and Value Predictor.

Read this carefully. This is the spine of the project.

## Project Roadmap — Priority × Time × Learning Value

### 🟢 Phase 0 — Foundation (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

> Goal: Make the project real, not theoretical.

| Priority | Feature                           | Est. Hours | Why it matters                               |
| -------- | --------------------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| P0       | Dataset input (CSV/JSON)          | 5–8        | Forces file handling, validation, edge cases |
| P0       | Data cleaning & validation        | 6–10       | Real DS work starts here, not models         |
| P0       | Basic stats (mean, variance, std) | 4–6        | Mathematical grounding                       |
| P0       | Correlation & covariance          | 6–8        | Core statistical intuition                   |
| P0       | Simple CLI output                 | 2–3        | Keeps UI minimal                             |

**Subtotal:** ~25–35 hrs
If you quit before this, the project never existed.

### 🟡 Phase 1 — Prediction Core (THIS IS THE HEART)

> Goal: Replicate the *Value Predictor feeling*, but deeper.

| Priority | Feature                           | Est. Hours | Why it matters                     |
| -------- | --------------------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------- |
| P1       | Linear regression (from formulas) | 8–12       | Forces math + implementation       |
| P1       | Multiple regression               | 8–12       | Real-world prediction starts here  |
| P1       | Prediction confidence (R², error) | 6–8        | Teaches model evaluation           |
| P1       | Human-readable reasoning          | 6–10       | Separates toy scripts from systems |
| P1       | Structured output (JSON/report)   | 4–6        | Professional output design         |

**Subtotal:** ~35–45 hrs
At this point, the project is already **resume-worthy**.

### 🟠 Phase 2 — Judgment & Insight Layer

> Goal: Make the system *think*, not just calculate.

| Priority | Feature                         | Est. Hours | Why it matters           |
| -------- | ------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------ |
| P2       | Feature importance scoring      | 8–12       | Bridges stats → ML       |
| P2       | Anomaly detection (statistical) | 6–10       | Practical DS skill       |
| P2       | Bias / data quality warnings    | 6–10       | Real analytical thinking |
| P2       | Decision summaries              | 4–6        | Communicating insights   |

**Subtotal:** ~25–35 hrs
This is where JudgeVision’s *spirit* lives.

### 🔴 Phase 3 — ML Transition (OPTIONAL BUT POWERFUL)

> Goal: Smooth entry into ML without black-box thinking.

| Priority | Feature                          | Est. Hours | Why it matters              |
| -------- | -------------------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------- |
| P3       | Logistic regression              | 6–8        | Classification fundamentals |
| P3       | Tree-based model (Random Forest) | 8–12       | Industry-relevant ML        |
| P3       | Model comparison                 | 6–8        | Real evaluation mindset     |
| P3       | Explainable ML output            | 6–10       | Avoids “ML monkey” trap     |

**Subtotal:** ~30–40 hrs

### 🔵 Phase 4 — Interface (ONLY AFTER CORE IS DONE)

> Goal: Minimal UI, maximum signal.

| Priority | Feature                 | Est. Hours | Why it matters         |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------- |
| P4       | Flask/FastAPI backend   | 6–10       | Backend exposure       |
| P4       | Simple web input/output | 6–8        | Visibility, not polish |
| P4       | Graphs (optional)       | 4–6        | Insight visualization  |

**Subtotal:** ~15–25 hrs

## 🧮 Total Project Size

* **Minimum serious version:** ~60–70 hrs
* **Proper full build:** ~100–120 hrs
* **Deep DS/ML version:** ~140+ hrs

This is **exactly** the scale where:

* You don’t get bored
* You are forced to learn
* The project compounds skill instead of being a demo

---

## Hard Rules (learn from past success)

1. **NO UI until Phase 2 is done**
2. **NO ML until regression & stats are solid**
3. **NO renaming mid-project**
4. **NO restarting — only refactoring**
5. **Ask for help only when blocked**, like you did with Budget Tracker
